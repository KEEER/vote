Vote API
========

This is the Vote public API package, currently work in progress. Deeply inspired by
the [Vue function API](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/function-apis/active-rfcs/0000-function-api.md).
This 'package' could be used in code using the name `@vote/api`.

Currently the API is still in heavy development and breaking changes may occur without
any prior notice.
